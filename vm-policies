Vulnerability Management Policy
1. Policy Overview
This policy establishes the framework for managing vulnerabilities within Stark Industries’ IT
infrastructure to uphold the security, confidentiality, and integrity of critical systems and data. It outlines
a structured approach to the timely identification, evaluation, and remediation of security threats, in
support of Stark Industries’ mission to lead innovation while maintaining operational resilience.
The policy was developed to proactively strengthen the organization's security posture by addressing
identified gaps in its vulnerability lifecycle. It provides a formal foundation for the launch of Stark
Industries’ Vulnerability Management Program (VMP), aligning technical remediation efforts with
business risk and regulatory requirements.
Through this program, Stark Industries commits to implementing a repeatable, risk-based process that
enables rapid response to vulnerabilities while ensuring collaboration across security, IT, compliance,
and business stakeholders.
2. Scope
This policy applies to all IT assets owned or operated by Stark Industries’, including:
● Servers (physical on-premises and virtual cloud-based)
● Endpoints (such as laptops, workstations, and mobile devices)
● Network hardware (such as routers, switches, firewalls)
● Software applications (such as platforms, internally customized, third-party, and middleware)
All employees, contractors, subsidiaries, and third-party vendors responsible for the use, operation,
management, or security of these assets of Stark Industries’ digital infrastructure are required to comply
with this policy.
3. Roles and Responsibilities
● Chief Information Security Officer (CISO):
○ Provides oversight of the Vulnerability Management Program (VMP).
○ Ensures compliance with this policy and reports risk trends to senior leadership.
● Chief Information Officer (CIO):
○ Integrates vulnerability management with Stark Industries’ overall IT strategy and
infrastructure roadmap.
● Department Heads:
○ Ensures team compliance with remediation timelines and security procedures.
○ Support coordination with IT and Security teams during mitigation efforts.
● IT and Security Teams:
○ Performs routine and ad-hoc vulnerability scans.
○ Triages findings and coordinates timely remediation.
○ Maintains vulnerability tracking and documentation.
4. Vulnerability Scan Schedule
● Routine Scans: Conduct monthly scans of all IT assets using approved vulnerability scanning
tools (e.g., Tenable, Qualys) to identify vulnerabilities.
● Ad-Hoc Scans: Perform in response to major security alerts, zero-day vulnerabilities, emerging
threats, or system changes.
● Post-Incident Scans: Initiated after confirmed security incidents to assess exposure and validate
fixes
5. Remediation Schedule and Cadence
Remediation timelines are based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):
Severity CVSS Score Range Remediation Timeline
Critical 9.0 – 10.0 Within 48 hours.
High 7.0 – 8.9 Within 7 calendar days.
Medium 4.0 – 6.9 Within 30 calendar days.
Low 0.1 – 3.9 Within 90 calendar days, or during the next standard
maintenance cycle.
6. Maintenance Plans
● Routine Patching: Apply operating system and application security patches and updates on a
scheduled monthly basis.
● Emergency Patching: Initiate within 24-48 hours for critical vulnerabilities that pose immediate
risks.
● Emergency Mitigation: Deploy temporary controls (e.g., firewall rules, access restrictions,
segmentation) to protect against vulnerabilities when patching is not immediately possible.
● Unpatchable Assets: Implement segmentation, increase monitoring, or plan phased removal from
the environment for unsupported or high-risk systems (e.g., legacy systems that cannot be
patched due to compatibility issues or vendor support limitations).
7. Non-Compliance Consequences
Failure to comply with this policy may result in the following:
● Immediate review of procedures, non-compliant systems or processes.
● Mandatory security retraining for involved personnel.
● Escalation to senior management and potential disciplinary action, including termination in cases
of gross negligence or misconduct.
9. Review and Revision
This policy will be reviewed annually or sooner if necessary to accommodate changes in business
processes or to address emerging threats.
