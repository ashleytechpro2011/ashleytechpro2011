 # 🌺 Hi, I'm Ashley also "Ngozi"!
 👋🏾 Welcome to my **Cybersecurity, Vulnerability & Risk Management, and Cloud Security Portfolio!**


 ## 📌 About Me  
Cybersecurity professional with experience supporting federal and enterprise environments across
risk management, vulnerability management, and security compliance.

My work focuses on assessing risk, strengthening security posture, and supporting authorization
and continuous monitoring efforts. I am expanding my scope into **cloud security engineering** with
an emphasis on **secure AWS architectures, identity and access management, and threat detection**.
